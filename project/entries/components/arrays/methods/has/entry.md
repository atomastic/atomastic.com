                           ],
                           'bad_times_at_the_el_royale' => [

                           ]
                        ]
                    ]);

if ($arrays->has('movies.the-thin-red-line')) {

    // Do something here...

    $title = $arrays->get('movies.the_thin_red_line.title');

    print_r($title);
}
