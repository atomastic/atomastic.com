                               'decription' => 'Adaptation of James Jones autobiographical 1962 novel, focusing on the conflict at Guadalcanal during the second World War.'
                           ],
                           'bad_times_at_the_el_royale' => [
                               'title' => 'Bad Times at the El Royale',
                               'directed_by' => 'Drew Goddard',
                               'produced_by' => 'Drew Goddard, Steve Asbell',
                               'decription' => 'Early 1970s. Four strangers check in at the El Royale Hotel. The hotel is deserted, staffed by a single desk clerk. Some of the new guests reasons for being there are less than innocent and some are not who they appear to be.'
                           ]
                        ]
                    ])->prepend(['tv-series']);

print_r($arrays->toArray());
```
