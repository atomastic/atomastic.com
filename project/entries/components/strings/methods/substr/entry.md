```php
// Returns the portion of string specified by the start 0.
$string1 = Strings::create('SG-1 returns from an off-world mission to P9Y-3C3')->substr(0);

// Returns the portion of string specified by the start 0 and length 4.
$string2 = Strings::create('SG-1 returns from an off-world mission to P9Y-3C3')->substr(0, 4);

echo $string1;

echo $string2;
