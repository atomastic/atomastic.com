public function segments(string $delimiter = ' '): array
```

#### Examples

```php
// Get array of segments from a string based on a predefined delimiter.
$segments1 = Strings::create('SG-1 returns from an off-world mission')->segments();

// Get array of segments from a string based on a delimiter '-'.
$segments2 = Strings::create('SG-1 returns from an off-world mission')->segments('-');

echo $segments1;

echo $segments2;
```

    [1] => returns
    [2] => from
    [3] => an
    [4] => off-world
